## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

hitprob = 0.1

#what is the value of a run? - 2 runs is great generally - derive from the back
#model with ability, setness, and aggression
Batability = seq(1,0,-0.1)
Faced <- 0*Batability

Bowlability = seq(1,0,-0.1)
Bowled <- 0*Bowlability

Outcomes = c(0,1,2,3,4,6)

overs <- 20

score <- 0;

Bat1 <- 1
Bat2 <- 2
Bowl <- 1
Strike <- 1
Outs <- 0
OnStrike <- c()
Runs <- c()
Bowler <- c()
OutProbs <- c()

for(i in 1:(overs*6)){
  if(Strike==1){
    OS <- Bat1
  }else{
    OS <- Bat2
  }
  OnStrike <- c(OnStrike,OS)
  Faced[OS] = Faced[OS] + 1
  Bowler <- c(Bowler,Bowl)
  outprob <- OP(Bowlability[Bowl],Batability[OS],Faced[OS],exp(i/20))
  OutProbs <- c(OutProbs,outprob)
  
  #Wicket 
  if(runif(1)<outprob){
    Outs <- Outs + 1
    Runs <- c(Runs,"W")
    if(Strike==1){
      Bat1 <- Outs+2
    }else{
      Bat2 <- Outs+2
    }
  }else{   #No wicket
    #Calculating runs scored - currently incremental, need to make into spinning wheel selection
    rating <- 1
    for(j in 1:(length(Outcomes)-1)){
      if(runif(1)>0.5){
        rating <- rating + Batability[OS]
      }
    }
    outcome = Outcomes[floor(rating)]
    if(outcome%%2 == 1){
      Strike = 3-Strike
    }
    
    Runs <- c(Runs,outcome)
    score <- score + outcome
  }
  if(i%%6 == 0){
    Strike = 3-Strike
    Bowled[Bowl] <- Bowled[Bowl] +1
    curBowl <- Bowl
    for(b in 1:length(Bowled)){
      if(b != curBowl && Bowled[b]<4){
        Bowl <- b
        break
      }
    }
  }
  if(Outs == 10){
    break
  }
  
}

innings <- data.frame(OnStrike,Runs,Bowler,OutProbs)
print(score)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
